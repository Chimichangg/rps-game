# Shall We Play A Game??

It’s late, and you are on your way home back to your base camp. Suddenly, there is a hostel beast stands in your way. The only way out is to fight and kill the beast…

You have 3 move choices: rock, paper, and scissors. The beast has the same. The only way to kill the beast is to defeat all 3 lives of the beast, while maintaining at least 1 lives out of 3. 

Scissors shred paper, paper beats rock, rock kills scissors. Are you ready?

## Update Note
Updated visual for more interactivity
Created moveComp function package
